What They are
#############

They're essentially a means for a server to send data to a client without the client having to make any requests.

How it Works (from a brief implementation perspective)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The client makes an event listener, just like any ol' event listener
   (click, mouseover, keypress, etc.).
2. The server sends the event (which has the same name as what the
   client is listening for) to standard output along with data (which
   can be something like a bit of JSON).
3. The client will receive this
   event and trigger the event callback.

Events being Generated Server-side
##################################

This table shows which SSE events are being generated by the backend. Anything
in angle brackets (<>) is a placeholder – <gameID> would be replaced by a
game id.

+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Event                | Format (what's in the "data:" payload)                                             |
+======================+====================================================================================+
| playerJoin           | [<username1>, <username2>, …]                                                      |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Writing Server-sent Event Generators (refers to events.py)
##########################################################

1. Write a new function that performs some "check" to decide whether an
   event should be generated.
   e.g.
   ::
       def check_game_playing_status(output_stream, game):
           if game.state == "playing":
               generate_game_start_event(game.uid, output_stream)

   See events.py for more examples, all of which are commented.

2. If the 'check' within the function you have written above
   passes, it should call another function (which you will write)
   to generate an event.
   e.g.
   ::
       def generate_game_start_event(game_id, output_stream):
           output_stream.write('event: gameStart\n')
           output_stream.write('data: %s\n' % (game_id))
           output_stream.write('\n\n')

   See the comments in generate_game_start_event() for some
   guidance on the sending of event types and the data payload.

3. Finally, add the call to the function you wrote in 1. above, to
   start_sse_stream().
   i.e.
   ::
       def start_sse_stream(output_stream=sys.stdout):
           ...
           while True:
               ...
               check_game_playing_status(output_stream, game)
               ...
               time.sleep(3)
           output_stream.flush()

   Make sure the call to your function is above the call to sleep()!
   There are a bunch of comments in start_sse_stream() which are
   worth a read, to supplement this README.
