#Welcome to the usage guide for Team 2's "A Monopoly Game"!

##Getting into the Game
###Here we will explain to you how to get started and play the game.

1. First, open a web browser meeting minimum requirements and when loading the web page for the first time you will be asked to enter a username.
  *Enter your chosen username in the text box and select the enter button.

2. You are then asked whether you would like to create a new game, or join an existing one.
  * If you choose to create a new game, you will be taken to a lobby
  * If you choose to join an existing game, a list of all available lobbies will appear. Choose one and select enter

3. Once 4 players have entered the lobby, the option to "Start Game" will be made available. Any player can press it to begin the game.

##Playing the Game
###Now that you're in the game, it's time to play!

The log on the left side of the screen will update with what's happening during your and your opponents' turns.

The game board itself is in the middle of the screen, each player is given a random token at the start of the game, be sure to note who is represented by which token!

On the right is your important information as well as how you'll interact with the game.

During **your turn** the following will occur:

1. Press the "roll dice" button to see what amount of spaces you will move this turn.
  * Your character will then move, space by space, to their destination.
  * If you pass "Go" during this movement, you will have 200 added to your balance.
  * If you roll a *double*, i.e. both dice we roll for you have the same result, you will be able to roll again after deciding to finish with the space you're currently on.
  * Be careful though! "If you roll a double 3 times in a row "you'll be sent to jail!
2. Depending on what you've landed on, you will be able to purchase unowned property, draw cards for special effects, pay rent, or more!
  * If you land on an *unowned* property, you will be given the option to buy it.
  * If you land on a property that "is" owned, you will have to pay rent to the owner at the end of the turn, unless the property is mortgaged.
  * Landing on a tax space will cost you a flat charge.
  * The \"community chest\" and \"chance\" spaces will draw a card from their respective decks. These can have positive or negative effects, with chance being likely to move you around the board itself!
  * The Go to jail space sends you to jail, the mechanics of which are detailed below.
  * The jail space itself when normally landed on is known as \"Just visiting\", and does nothing, just like the space "Free Parking".
3. If you own all the properties of the same colour on the board, they form a monopoly.
  * This means that they will charge higher rent, and will be available to have houses placed on them.
4. The option will be available to mortgage your currently owned properties to get extra funds by no longer being able to earn rent from the property until the mortgage is repaid.
  * This is done by means of a drop-down menu. Select what properties you want to mortgage and press the "Mortgage" button to do so.
  * The same can be done in reverse using the "Unmortgage" drop-down and button.
5. Once the "end turn" button is selected any payments made will be deducted and the next player gets to play.
  * If you do not have the cash to pay your rent at the end of the turn, you will be rendered bankrupt and will be out of the game.
  * If you rolled a double, your turn will appear to *begin again*, with the option to roll the dice.
