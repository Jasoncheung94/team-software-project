#Welcome to the usage guide for Team 2's "A Monopoly Game"!

##Getting into the Game
###Here we will explain to you how to get started and play the game.

1. First, open a web browser meeting minimum requirements and when loading the web page for the first time you will be asked to enter a username.
  *Enter your chosen username in the text box and select the enter button.

2. You are then asked whether you would like to create a new game, or join an existing one.
  * If you choose to create a new game, you will be taken to a lobby
  * If you choose to join an existing game, a list of all available lobbies will appear. Choose one and select enter

3. Once 4 players have entered the lobby, the option to "Start Game" will be made available.

##Playing the Game
###Now that you're in the game, it's time to play!

The screen will update with what's happening during your opponents' turns.
During **your turn** the following will occur:

1. Press the "roll dice" button to see what amount of spaces you will move this turn.
  * Your character will then move.
2. Depending on what you've landed on, you will be able to purchase unowned property, draw cards for special effects, pay rent, or more!
3. The option will be available to mortgage your currently owned properties to get extra funds by no longer being able to get rent from the property until the mortgage is repaid.
4. Once the "end turn" button is selected any payments made will be deducted and the next player gets to play.
  * If you do not have the cash to pay your rent at the end of the turn, you will be rendered bankrupt and will be out of the game.
